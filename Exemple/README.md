# ExempleDashboard

Here is an example of a simple dashboard that works.

- Add the contents of the configuration.yaml file to your file. If elements are already present, do not remove them, copy only the missing parts.
- Copy the contents of the sensors.yaml file into your file.
  - Adapt the names of the sensors according to the names that your installation has generated
- Create a My-Dashbord directory
- Copy the My-Dashboard.yaml and WeatherflowTempest.yaml files inside.
  - Adapt the names of the sensors according to the names that your installation has generated
